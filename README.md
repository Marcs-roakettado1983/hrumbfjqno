Wow, so I just stumbled outta Screamboat and - whew, what even was that? My ears are still ringing. Man, that theater was almost as noisy as a haunted school bus filled with broken drums. Trying to send you a message but yknow I’ll probably mix up some bits here... the movie, my own mess of thoughts. And the popcorn! Still finding crumbs in my hoodie pocket, like treasure from a crunchy past life.

> So the movie - oh yeah, yeah, it’s like if you took Friday the 13th and sent it to clown college on a sinking ship. There was this one scene with a guy flipping pancakes as if they were ninja stars. Back aching, felt like I was hunched on that creaky old boat myself. But those pancakes, the way they soared... kinda like frisbees but angrier.

> The killer, what’s-his-name, had this mask which reminded me of a squished marshmallow. You know how those goopy marshmallows stick to your fingers? Think that but with an undercurrent of doom. Really wished I’d remembered to bring those noise-canceling headphones – the screams were louder than my aunt’s karaoke machine during family reunions.

Oh right, someone asked if they could download the movie. Probably wouldn’t suggest that unless it’s raining or you’ve already sorted your Lego collection by size, colour, and existential drift.

This one character, who legit walked with a limp at the beginning, ends up sprinting from room to room like the Flash on espresso. Nosense. And people say gravity's a fixed rule? Missed half her dialogue because some kid two rows back kept syncing his burps with the movie’s sound effects. Almost artistic in a weird, stomach-churning way.

> Oh! I almost forgot - the music threw me for a loop. It shifted around like a cat deciding whether or not to sit on your laptop. Sometimes intense, sometimes just... there. Really added to the chaos in such a way I questioned my own life choices. And did anyone else spot that rogue rubber duck floating by in the background or was it just my sleep-deprived eyes?

And yeah, if you're feeling brave or just for pure perplexity, I'd say watch the movie. Maybe do it during daylight tho.
